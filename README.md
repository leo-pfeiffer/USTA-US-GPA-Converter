# Uni St Andrews GPA to US GPA Converter

Since the University of St Andrews uses their own weird grading scale, this is a converter to US GPA based on the official conversion [table](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/administration/academicdatateam/assessmentandawards/undergraduateinformation/).

Use the [App](https://st-andrews-gpa-converter.netlify.app/).
